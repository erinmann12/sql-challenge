# sql-challenge

**Background**

As a fictitious data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I was assigned to conduct a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. For this challenge, I was tasked to use SQL to design tables to hold six CSV files, import the files into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.

**Tools Used**

1. SQL
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas

**Project Tasks**

First, I created a table scheme for each file specifying data types, primary keys and foreign keys. I also used an ER Diagram to visualize how each table was connected to each other. 

Next, I used data analysis to answer a series of questions about the data and used tactics such as joins and select statements. 
Finally, for the bonus analysis, I imported the SQL database into Pandas and visualized the data in a histogram and bar chart.
