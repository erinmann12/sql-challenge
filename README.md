# sql-challenge

For this challenge, I was tasked to use SQL to design tables to hold six CSV files, import the files into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.
I created a table scheme for each file specifying data types, primary keys and foreign keys.
Next, I used data analysis to answer a series of questions about the data and used tactics such as joins and select statements. 
Finally, for the bonus anlysis, I imported the SQL database into Pandas and visualized the data in a histogram and bar chart.
